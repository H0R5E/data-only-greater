title: Notes on Roache et al. (1986)
---

<p><em>Roache, P. J., Ghia, K. N., &amp; White, F. M. (1986). Editorial policy statement
on the control of numerical accuracy. Journal of Fluids Engineering, 108, 2.</em></p>
<p>This is the first Journal to demand some form of formal uncertainty
quantification. Particularly interesting quote is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;a single calculation in a fixed grid will not be acceptable, since it is
impossible to infer an accuracy estimate from such a calculation. Also, the
editors will not consider a  reasonable agreement with experimental data to
be sufficient proof of accuracy, especially if any adjustable parameters are
involved, as in turbulence modeling.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was this the split for wave energy modelling? Or did it just not consider itself
a fluid? Not governed by the same restraints perhaps?</p>
