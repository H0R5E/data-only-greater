<h1>Add multiple wave analysis

<div class="description">
<p>In order to coincide with the work of Gretton and MaGuire I need to look
at all of the peaks of the waves not just one. I suggest that this requires
some assumptions on the motions of the waves and a clearer definition of 
where the wave starts and finished will be required.</p>

	I have finished with the group branch and merged that into the 
trunk and created a tag called region only. This update fixes 
a number of the other bugs for this release also, but I still need
to decide whether to do some aggregated result like Eoghans tables.
I might move that to 0.4 release.

	I'm doing this in a branch called group. I'm expecting this
branch to become the trunk once this process is finished.
There are one or two regressions that need fixing before that
can be done however.

	This actually has an impact on the reporting as well as each wave will
require it's own folder (at least I think this is the neatest approach)
It could be that later the data is amalgamated into a nice table like
Eoghans.
