I have been studying marine renewable energy since September 2002, so at the
time of writing, nearly 13 years (although there are some gaps). Sadly, to my
discredit I have not always taken all of the opportunites that studying in this
unique field have offered me. One such opportunity was to become actively
involved in a young researchers network called [INORE](http://inore.org/).
This was a time of my life where I was bitter, big headed and small
minded (gotta love PhDs), and so, rather than try it out, I simply heaped
scorn on my friends that were involved.

But I've changed since then, and I am becoming more like the person I want to be
again. Yet still, when another opportunity to attend INORE came along,
familiar sentiments returned: "I'm too old", "I'm not that kind of person",
"Why would I waste my time?". I couldn't have been more wrong.

Fortunately for me, my close friend and colleague Vincenzo seemed less
enthusiastic than me. I am assuming that he was doing this for my benefit as
he is one of the worlds good people. It also made sense from a technical
perspective as I was to present a piece software that he can't use, as yet.
That piece of software is [DTOcean](http://www.dtocean.eu/) my current charge
and for the next 15 months. I have a lot to thank DTOcean for as, along with
the [EU Marie Sk&#0322;odowska-Curie actions](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/)
programme, it  has brought me to Bilbao in the Basque Country and an exciting
(and challenging) new life.

I will say more about DTOcean at a later date, as we have just begun to
publisise its existance and there is lots of interesting stuff to tell (maybe
even a slot at [Europython](https://ep2015.europython.eu/en/). Woo!). The
presentation at INORE, in Vico Equense in southern Italy, was the 3rd of a
group of four presentations of our "Alpha version" over 2 months, a period
throughout which the software has been getting more alpha all the time. Sadly
this has stolen a good 3 months of my social life (and Spanish learning), so I
hope Derwyn (my pet name for DTOcean) appreciates my sacrifise. The last
presentation is tomorrow.

I did not have my travelling hat on when I arrived in Italy, and was feeling
a bit out of sorts. These feelinngs quickly faded, however. Firstly, Vico
Equense is incredibly stunning.
