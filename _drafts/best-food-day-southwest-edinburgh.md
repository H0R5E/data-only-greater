So this is a quick post about eating in southwest Ediburgh, around the 
Bruntsfield, Morningside sort of way. I came to writing this because I am
not living in Edinburgh anymore and I miss the culinary posibilites that
it had to offer. I thought this could also help out someone that doesn't know
where to eat in southwest Edinburgh (?) and plug a few of my favourite
businesses at the same time. So, where shall we begin?

## Breakfast

Seems like a very appropriate place to start, breakfast is, after all, the most
important meal of the day! Also, Edinburgh has some *great* breakfast options,
so I am going to suggest TWO places where you could have breakfast, (or where
you could have two breakfasts, up to you).

The first is super reliable and super nice and definitely worth a quick trip to
Marchmont to visit **Toast** at some address.
