I am pleased to announce the unofficial launch of www.dataonlygreater.com.
Note, it is the *unofficial launch* in case we can have a better party with an
official opening. Here is a nice picture of Augusta and I enjoying the
festivities.

So what are we celebrating? Well dataonlygreater is the new conduit for me,
Mathew Topper, (find out more [about me here]({{ site.baseurl }}/about)) to express my most geeky
thoughts (both personal and proffesional) and share some of the stuff I have
been working on, in some ways for the greater good, i.e. open source code.

Currently, the content here is mostly a collection of other work that was
still available on the web ([mathematicaltopper.wordpress.com](
https://mathematicaltopper.wordpress.com/), [marineresearcher.wordpress.com](
https://marineresearcher.wordpress.com)) or are beyond my control or closed
([www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/iesscicomp](
https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/iesscicomp), www.see.ed.ac.uk/~mtopper). The
wordpress blogs I will be shutting down as repeated content is bad and the 
inability to access the other stuff was one of my primary reasons for doing
this anyway.

I should say that none of this would have been possible without the amazing
piece of software that is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Its a great system
that I thoroughly recommend you try. I must also thank [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo)
for developing [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) and [Joshua Lande](
http://joshualande.com) for showing me the way. This template is the backbone of the site
you see before you. There are also many little concepts and styles that I have
pinched from places accross the web, so thanks for sharing!

Well, that's it. Hopefully I will be adding more content on a regular basis and
improving what is already here. And, if you're here looking for the University
of Edinburgh Thesis template, don't worry the page you need is [here](
{{ site.baseurl }}/software/edengths). Thanks for popping by!
