I have been studying marine renewable energy since September 2002 so, at the 
time of writing, nearly 13 years. Sadly, to my discredit, I have not always 
taken all of the opportunities that studying in this unique field have offered 
me. One such opportunity was to become actively involved in a young researchers 
network called [INORE](http://inore.org/) during my PhD. This was a time of my 
life where I was bitter, big headed and small minded (gotta love PhDs), and so, 
rather than try it out, I simply heaped scorn on my friends that were involved.

I like to think that I've changed since then, and I am becoming more like the 
person I want to be. Yet still, when another opportunity to attend INORE came 
along, familiar sentiments returned: "I'm too old", "I'm not that kind of 
person", "Why would I waste my time?". I couldn't have been more wrong.

My closest colleague could have gone instead of me but, fortunately for me, 
he seemed less enthusiastic to go than I did. Indeed, I know now that he was 
saying this for my benefit as he is one of the world's super nice people. It 
also made sense from a technical perspective as we needed to present a piece 
software that he can't use, as yet. That piece of software is 
[DTOcean](http://www.dtocean.eu/) - my current charge and will be for the next 
15 months. I have a lot to thank DTOcean for as, along with the [EU Marie 
Sk&#0322;odowska-Curie Actions](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) 
programme, it has brought me to Bilbao and an exciting (and challenging) new 
life.

I will say more about DTOcean at a later date, as we have just begun to 
publicise its existence and there is lots of interesting stuff to tell (maybe 
even a slot at [Europython](https://ep2015.europython.eu/en/) (woo!). The 
presentation at INORE, in Vico Equense in southern Italy, was the 3rd of a group 
of four presentations of our "Alpha version" over 2 months, a period throughout 
which the software has been getting more alpha all the time. Sadly, including 
some intense preparation time, this has stolen a good 3 months of my social life 
(and Spanish learning), so I hope Derwyn (my pet name for DTOcean) appreciates 
my sacrifice. The last presentation is next week.

I did not have my travelling hat on when I arrived in Italy, and was feeling a 
bit out of sorts. These feelings quickly faded, however. Firstly, I had a 
calzone. Secondly, Vico Equense is incredibly stunning.

The hand you see in the last picture is that of my bed and breakfast host, 
Peppe. The pictures above were taken because of his generosity in offering 
me a hair raising ride on the back of his moped for an hour long tour of the 
locality about Vico Equense. This was truly one of the best experiences of my 
life, so if you ever happen to stay at the [Bed & Breakfast Maria 
Grazia](http://www.bbmariagrazia.it) and Peppe offers you a ride, take it. The 
B&amp;B is also a lovely building and he has some of the largest lemons I've 
ever seen... Just remember to take a car, as it's a bit isolated.

So it was a good start to my journey, and the next stage was to meet the INORE 
gang at the hostel up the road. Now, I wouldn't say that I didn't know anybody, 
in fact a colleague from my current work was attending along with colleagues 
from the University of Edinburgh. The joy was that I hardly spoke to them 
throughout much of my time there as I met with such a nice welcome from the 
group as a whole. OK, everyone was looking a little tired (the days and nights 
are long at INORE), but this had not dampened the open and inclusive spirit of 
the group. Indeed, this will be my enduring memory of the trip, feeling at home 
among like-minded people and having fun with old friends and, I hope, new ones 
as well. I will remember that feeling, and also seeing one of the most 
beautiful sunsets of my life from the roof of the hostel; one of those 
perfect little moments of life.

Beyond a great social experience, the trip also proved very useful from a work 
perspective. The feedback we received from the group of young researchers after 
my presentation of DTOcean was very detailed and thought through, and really 
highlighted the embarrassment of young intellect in the room. From both an 
intellectual and social perspective I left INORE totally satisfied.

In fact, I was extremely sad to leave when I did (two and a half days before the 
end), and upset with myself for never taking the risk to try it when I could 
justify spending the entire week there. If I could, I would have gone back 
instantly and implored everyone else to stay in that beautiful place for ever 
more. Still, life goes on but if you are a young researcher in offshore energy 
and have ever thought of trying INORE or even if you think its not for you, I 
would urge you to give it a try and not make the same mistake as me. I feel 
extremely lucky and privileged to get a second chance, but I wish I had taken my 
first.
