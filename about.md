<h1 class="one" id="introduction"><span>Introduction</span></h1>

I'm Mathew Bernard Robert Topper, an English guy currently living in Ireland.
I have a PhD from from the [Engineering department](http://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/)
of the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/) based on the topic of
[Marine Renewable Energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_energy#Renewable)
in the field of [Scientific Computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science).
I continue to work both on this topic and within this field.

In my spare time, I like to mess about with computers (obviously), but I also
like sports such as cycling, snowboarding, and many more. I also enjoy normal
pursuits like spending time with my family, listening to music and watching
films.

<h1 class="one" id="where"><span>Where to Find Me</span></h1>

A few of the pursuits mentioned above have led me to have some other homes on 
the internet. These are described in the sections below.

### Professional

I have profession profiles on the following services:

* [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/mathew-topper/35/512/531)
* [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Topper)
* [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=di-ePxIAAAAJ&hl=en)

### Computerising

I have some open source code projects (mainly in Python), that are described
on the Software page, and most of these are hosted at

* [GitHub](https://github.com/H0R5E)

### Music

I like to share my music preferences with those that are interested. You
can listen to some of my favourite new and old stuff at:

* [Soundcloud.com](https://soundcloud.com/h0r5e/)
* [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/H0R5E)

<h1 class="one" id="contact"><span>Contact</span></h1>

If you would like to contact me, why not try my twitter account
[@H0R5E](https://twitter.com/h0r5e). I am a terrible twitter ignorer, so maybe
some chat will encourage me to engage with it some more!

<h1 class="one" id="acknowledgements"><span>Acknowledgements</span></h1>

Big love to Mum and [Lucy](http://cat-bounce.com/) for being so awesome!

Thanks for reading!
