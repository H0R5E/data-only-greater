  Hey there! You're interested in the author of this website... me!
  This page describes something about me and my presence across the interwebs.
</p>

## Introduction

I'm Mathew Bernard Robert Topper, an English guy currently living in Bilbao.
I have a PhD from from the [Engineering department](http://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/)
of the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/) based on the topic of
[Marine Renewable Energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_energy#Renewable)
in the field of [Scientific Computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science).
I continue to work both on this topic and within this field.

In my spare time, I like to mess about with computers (obviously), but I also
like sports such as cycling, snowboarding, and many more. I also enjoy normal
pursuits like listening to music and watching films. I'm a particularly
awful Formula One (F1) geek, to the point where I'm willing to get up very early to watch
not even the race and own hats and little cars that mean nothing to anyone
except other awful F1 geeks!

## Where to Find Me

A few of the pursuits mentioned above have led me to have some other homes on the internet.
These are described in the sections below.

### Professional

I have profession profiles on the following services:

* [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/mathew-topper/35/512/531)
* [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathew_Topper)
* [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=di-ePxIAAAAJ&hl=en)

### Computerising

I have some open source code projects (mainly in Python), that are described
on the Software page, and most of these are hosted at

* [Bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/topper)

I also am a keen user of the
[Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)
and I package various python projects for Anaconda which can be found at

* [Binstar.org](https://binstar.org/topper)

Because I contribute bug reports to various python projects I also have a 
[GitHub](https://github.com/H0R5E) account, but I do not tend to develop code over
this platform as I think Mercurial is easier to use than Git (especially on
Windows).

### Music

I like to share my music preferences with those that are interested. You
can listen to some of my favourite new and old stuff at:

* [Soundcloud.com](https://soundcloud.com/h0r5e/)
* [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/H0R5E)

### Formula One

Just a quick plug for [F1Technical.net](http://www.f1technical.net/), where I like
to be boring with all the other F1 geeks. I'm sure you can work out my user name!

## Contact

If you would like to contact me, why not try my twitter account
[@H0R5E](https://twitter.com/h0r5e). I am a terrible twitter ignorer, so maybe
some chat will encourage me to engage with it some more!

## Acknowledgements

Big love to Mum and Lucy for being so awesome!

Thanks for reading!
