## New Lay Summary Section

The unofficial University of Edinburgh latex PhD thesis template, [[edengths]],
has been updated to include the new requirement of a "Lay Summary" section.
This follows changes to the thesis regulations at The University of Edinburgh.
The summary section is added by using the latex command _\summary_ within the
precntnt.tex file. This is included by default in both the standard and
nomenclature versions of the template.

## Migration to Github

To provide a more friendly environment for collaborative development of
edengths I have moved the code from Bitbucket to Github. The repository can now
be found [here](https://github.com/H0R5E/edengths). Contributors should follow
similar rules to those laid out for [[DTOcean Development&colon; Change Management]].
The main difference with edengths is that two branches are supported - the
master branch which contains the standard template and the nomencl branch which
contains the version including a nomenclature.
