I am pleased to announce the unofficial launch of www.dataonlygreater.com.
Note, it is the _unofficial launch_ in case we can have a better party with an
official opening. Here is a nice picture of Augusta and I enjoying the
festivities.

So what are we celebrating? Well dataonlygreater is the new conduit for me,
Mathew Topper, (find out more [about me here](/#about/) to express my most geeky
thoughts (both personal and professional) and share some of the stuff I have
been working on, in some ways for the greater good, i.e. open source code.

Currently, the content here is mostly a collection of other work that was still
available on the web
([mathematicaltopper.wordpress.com](https://mathematicaltopper.wordpress.com/),
[marineresearcher.wordpress.com](https://marineresearcher.wordpress.com)) or
are beyond my control or closed
([www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/iesscicomp](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/iesscicomp),
www.see.ed.ac.uk/~mtopper). The wordpress blogs I will be shutting down as
repeated content is bad and the inability to access the other stuff was one of
my primary reasons for doing this anyway.

I should say that none of this would have been possible without the amazing
piece of software that is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Its a great system
that I thoroughly recommend you try. I must also thank
[@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) for developing
[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) and [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com)
for showing me the way. This template is the backbone of the site you see
before you. There are also many little concepts and styles that I have pinched
from places across the web, so thanks for sharing!

Well, that's it. Hopefully I will be adding more content on a regular basis and
improving what is already here. And, if you're here looking for the University
of Edinburgh Thesis template, don't worry the page you need is
[[edengths:here]]. Thanks for popping by!
