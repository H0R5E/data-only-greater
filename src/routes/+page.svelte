        Hi, my name is Mathew Topper and <i>Data Only Greater</i> is my consultancy
        business. I have a degree in mathematics from the University of Southampton
        and a PhD from the University of Edinburgh. I have worked for universities,
        consultancies, not-for-profits and, most recently, for myself. My roles typically
        involve research and development, particularly for ocean energy, and software
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have significant experience in technology transfer, turning complex
        ideas into concrete products. I have developed products for desktop and
        web, from design to deployment. I have helped my teams adopt modern
        technologies, allowing them to develop new and existing products more
        efficiently.

            <i>BlueBox</i> was a 2 year, sustainable energy authority of Ireland
            funded, R&amp;D project, with the goal of developing an IoT system for
            renewably powered offshore sensing platforms. The internet and Iridium

            <i>DTOcean</i> is a desktop application for techno-economic modelling
            of ocean energy arrays. It was initially developed as part of â‚¬10 million,
            3-year EU project with over 10 partners, and subsequently enhanced by

            <i>ForeCoastÂ® Marine</i> is an online decision support tool for offshore
            operations developed by JBA Consulting. The Control Desk module provides
            detailed weather window and vessel routing predictions based on simulations
            powered by ensemble weather and metocean forecasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with the UK Met Office, I developed simulation pipelines to
            convert the ensemble forecasts into initial conditions for numerical
            models (such as SWAN). I also automated the execution of the
            simulations and processed the results to create statistical
            predictions for local conditions within a site of interest.
